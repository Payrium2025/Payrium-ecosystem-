My name is Petro Smahliuk, Founder & CEO of Payrium. We are building a Web3 investment ecosystem that funds early-stage startups via decentralized governance and creates real utility for the PUM token (BEP-20). Payrium consists of three integrated components:

- Payrium Wallet (MVP): low-fee, user-friendly BEP-20/EVM wallet with staking, multi-chain support, and on-chain identity.
- Payrium DAO: decentralized governance for funding allocation, treasury management, and platform upgrades.
- Startup Investment Platform: curated marketplace for early-stage teams to apply for funding; approved projects share a percentage of profits with the ecosystem.

Why Payrium
- Democratizes access to early-stage venture opportunities for retail investors.
- Creates sustainable utility for PUM through staking, DAO voting, and platform access.
- Built on BNB Chain / EVM for scalability and low transaction costs.
- Focused on delivering infrastructure (wallet, DAO, auditable investment flows), not speculative token hype.

Grant request
We are requesting a builder grant in the range of $50,000–$100,000 (depending on the foundation’s available tier). Funds will be allocated to:
- Developer compensation (smart contract & frontend/backend)
- Smart contract audits and security
- Infrastructure (nodes, servers) and CI/testing
- Product security, testing, and deployment
- Onboarding tools & documentation for startups

Key deliverables & timeline (examples)
- Month 0–2: Wallet MVP (core send/receive, staking integration, basic UI) — deliverable: public demo + repo
- Month 1–3: DAO smart contracts & governance UI — deliverable: on-chain governance contract + docs
- Month 2–4: Investment platform backend + smart contracts (application, vesting, revenue share) — deliverable: working integration tests + deployment scripts
- Month 3–5: Security audits (third-party) and bug bounties — deliverable: audit reports + mitigation plan
- Month 4–6: Production rollout of integrations and startup onboarding toolkit — deliverable: onboarding docs, sample applications, and analytics dashboard

Success metrics
- Wallet MVP: 1,000 MAUs within 6 months of MVP launch
- DAO: >1,500 unique token-holder voters on initial proposals
- Investment platform: 10 curated startups onboarded in first 12 months
- Security: zero critical on-chain findings post-audit; public audit reports published
