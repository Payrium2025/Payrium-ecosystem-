We are building a Web3 investment ecosystem that funds early-stage startups via decentralized governance and creates real utility for the PUM token (BEP-20). Payrium consists of three integrated components:

- Payrium Wallet (MVP): low-fee, user-friendly BEP-20/EVM wallet with staking, multi-chain support, and on-chain identity.
- Payrium DAO: decentralized governance for funding allocation, treasury management, and platform upgrades.
- Startup Investment Platform: curated marketplace for early-stage teams to apply for funding; approved projects share a percentage of profits with the ecosystem.

Why Payrium
- Democratizes access to early-stage venture opportunities for retail investors.
- Creates sustainable utility for PUM through staking, DAO voting, and platform access.
- Built on BNB Chain / EVM for scalability and low transaction costs.
- Focused on delivering infrastructure (wallet, DAO, auditable investment flows), not speculative token hype.

Grant request
We are requesting a builder grant in the range of $50,000–$100,000 (depending on the foundation’s available tier). Funds will be allocated to:
- Developer compensation (smart contract & frontend/backend)
- Smart contract audits and security
- Infrastructure (nodes, servers) and CI/testing
- Product security, testing, and deployment
- Onboarding tools & documentation for startups


Thank you for considering Payrium. I’m happy to provide any additional technical materials or onboarding documentation you’d like to review.

Best regards,
Petro Smahliuk
